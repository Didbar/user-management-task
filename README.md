# User Management System

This User Management System is a frontend application developed using Chakra UI, React Query, Zustand, React Hook Form, and React Router DOM. It allows users to manage a list of users and groups with various features.

## Features

- View a list of existing users.
- View a list of existing groups.
- Create new users.
- Create new groups.
- Assign users to a group they aren't already part of.
- Remove users from a group.
- Delete groups when they no longer have members.
- Delete users.

## Libraries Used

- **[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/):** Flexible and accessible UI component library for React.
- **[React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/):** Library for managing and caching asynchronous data.
- **[Zustand](https://zustand.surge.sh/):** Small and fast state management library for React.
- **[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/):** Library for managing forms with React.
- **[React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/):** Declarative routing for React.js.
- **[Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod):** TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.

## Why These Libraries?

- **Chakra UI:**
  - Chakra UI was chosen for its flexibility and accessibility. Its component library allowed for the rapid development of a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

- **React Query:**
  - React Query is a powerful library for managing asynchronous data. Its caching mechanism and declarative approach simplify data fetching and state management, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Zustand:**
  - Zustand was selected as the state management library for its simplicity and efficiency. It provides a minimalistic API, making it easy to manage state in React components without sacrificing performance.

- **React Hook Form:**
  - React Hook Form was used to simplify form management in the application. Its hook-based approach and efficient form validation capabilities made it a suitable choice for handling user input.

- **React Router DOM:**
  - React Router DOM is a widely adopted routing library for React.js. Its declarative routing system allowed for the seamless navigation between different views in the User Management System.

- **Zod:**
  - Zod, being a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, was chosen to enforce type safety in data handling. It ensures that data conforms to expected structures, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

These libraries were carefully selected to strike a balance between functionality, developer experience, and performance in building a robust User Management System.
